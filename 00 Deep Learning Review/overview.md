# Generative Adversarial Networks

First, some resources to check out.

- [Ian Goodfellow's tutorial on Generative Adversarial Networks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1701.00160.pdf)
- [Collection of state of the art GAN papers](https://github.com/GKalliatakis/Delving-deep-into-GANs)

Generative Adversarial Networks, or GANs, are part of the state of the art approaches to several tasks including those that require the generation of examples and semi-supervised tasks (those where much of the training data is unlabeled).

The course starts with a review of Deep Learning principles, focusing on networks that deal with image data. It is recommended to have access to a GPU enabled machine.
